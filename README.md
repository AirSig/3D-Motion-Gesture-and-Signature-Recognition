# AirSig 3D Motion Gesture and Signature Recognition

The best 3D motion gesture recognition accuracy you can find. Make your players just like Harry Potter!

In addition, it also provides a better solution for authentication. Just sign your name in the air to pass authentication!

### Key Features

* **Developer-defined Gestures:**

  You can define the gestures you want to be recognized, by giving gesture samples.

* **Built-in Gestures:**

  An addition for Developer-defined Gestures, 3 built-in gestures, “heart” gesture, “C” gesture and “^” gesture are ready-to-use in AirSig SDK. Developers can make players draw a symbol to perform skills. For example, drawing a “heart” to recover health point, a “C” to fast change weapons, or a “^” to make a "lightning" attack.

* **Player-defined Gestures:**

  To make it even more fun for players, AirSig SDK allows players to easily create whatever gestures they want in the applications real time.

* **Signature Authentication:**

  AirSig SDK can make players fast authenticate themselves. A player creates his signature at first. Then he can just sign his signature in the air to authenticate in 1 second whenever he needs to login or pay , instead of typing passwords. 
  
* **High Accuracy:**

  AirSig’s accuracy is around 98% for gesture recognition, depending on the gesture amount and condition. The more users use it, the more accurate it will be.
  
  For signature authentication, the pass rate is over 98% and hacked probability is less than 0.001%, which is equivalent to NIST requirement and certified to meet financial requirement.
